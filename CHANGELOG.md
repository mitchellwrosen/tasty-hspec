# Changelog

## [1.2.0.4] - 2023-04-25

- Add support for `hspec-2.11`
- Drop support for `hspec-2.10`
- Drop support for GHC < 8.4

## [1.2.0.3] - 2023-01-11

- Drop support for `hspec < 2.10`, `hspec-core < 2.10`, `tasty < 1.3`, and `tasty-quickcheck < 0.9.1`. This was done to
  eliminate CPP and reduce maintenance burden. Moving forward, this library will opt to tighten compatibility bounds
  when dependencies make breaking changes, rather than reintroduce CPP.
